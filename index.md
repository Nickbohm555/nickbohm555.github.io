<h2>Current Work</h2>
<p>I'm currently working on one of PwC’s leading AI initiatives, where I design containerized FastAPI + LangGraph microservices to automate risk analysis and compliance workflows. My focus is on building scalable AI systems that connect structured data, retrieval pipelines, and LangChain sub-agents for enterprise-grade performance.</p>

<h2>Tech Interests</h2>
<p>I’m deeply interested in the intersection of <strong>AI agents</strong>, <strong>data orchestration</strong>, and <strong>distributed systems</strong>. I explore frameworks like LangGraph, FastStream, and Redis-based checkpointing to build multi-agent pipelines, while also studying algorithmic problem-solving and large-scale system design.</p>

<h2>Hobbies</h2>
<p>Outside of work, I train in <strong>Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu</strong>, lift weights, and study <strong>Japanese</strong>. I also enjoy traveling to historical cities — from Antigua to Varanasi — and documenting architecture, food, and culture through photography and writing.</p>
