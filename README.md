### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

My name is Nick Bohm and I'm a junior at Columbia studying Computer Science. I grew up in the bay area and now live in NYC. For fun I like to play tennis, lift weights, train martial arts, and travel whenever possible. I am currently working as a cofounder for a pre-seed startup building an app in react native, firebase, and solidity.
